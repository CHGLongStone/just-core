# Getting Started with just-core

Read the project summary <a href="https://chglongstone.github.io/just-core">here</a> if you haven't yet.

The best place to get hands on with just-core is with the [just-core-stub](../just-core-stub) application 
as an example how how to use the framework or to initialize a new project. 
Dependency management is handled through [Composer and Packagist](Packages-and-Extensions)
