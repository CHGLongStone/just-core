## AnOTHER PHP Framework?

WhY?

### tired of dealing with other frameworks

With nearly 2 decades in the language the principle developer has seen the bloat factor from 

* _hyper abstraction_ for accessibility 
* _pre-optimization_ or the _no optimization required_ mindset 
* [Clever vs Intelligent Programming]()

* enforcing syntactical or design patterns that provide significant encumbrance without adding significant value if they:
  * undermine the ability to optimize performance through bloated application structure 
  * require developers to pragmatically speaking _learn a new language_
  


* no matter what you get off the shelf you MUST develop your own IP to differentiate in the market


## Clever vs Intelligent Programming

_Clever_ is the mindset that must _innovate_ _EVERY SOLUTION_ ... which ignores the facts that 

* probably hundreds of thousands of other software engineers have probable looked at the problem
  * there are in MOST software engineering situations clear guidelines for best practices
* your particular preferences mean NOTHING to the bottom line unless they provide business value by:
  * Understanding that someone else needs to read your shit at some point down the line
    * Adhering to common standards and writing code that is intuitive or effectively documented 
	  * minimize the level of effort when you or someone else needs to look at it in 6, 18 or 36+ months later

_Intelligent_ is a mindset of maturity well described in a lecture by ["Uncle" Bob Martin in "The Future of Programming"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecIWPzGEbFc) 
in the analysis of gender and maturity and the transformation from it's genesis to becoming an industry 

## Shoulders of Giants

["Uncle" Bob Martin in "The Future of Programming"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecIWPzGEbFc) effectively elucidates a number of 
demonstrable issues in the software industry 

### in the analysis of gender distribution and _life maturity_ through the transformation from it's genesis to becoming an industry 



### the mindset of the _un-refined_ male and its impact on the structure and practices within the industry

* thinking the _new way is better_ as bob points out there are ONLY 3 fundamental _meta patterns_ in modern coding languages 
  * functional
  * structured 
  * object 

* the tensions around ownership of risk management and the ownership of risk
